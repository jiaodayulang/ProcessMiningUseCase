Credit Memo Governance and Analysis 
@This was shared on LinedIn in March 2024.


Attending the International BPM Conference in 2022 and 2023 has been a fantastic and transformative journey for me. 

During the Conference in Utrecht last year, I was inspired by Prof. Wil van der Aalst's keynote on object-centric process mining and Sebastiaan J. (Bas) van Zelst's  label-splitting method, which were extremely helpful for me to develop solutions for credit memo process from scratch.
 
hashtag#MainIssues - One of the most challenging aspects of my work lies in the Credit Memo Governance process, which involves more than 10 types of credit memos has been a long-standing issues from our stakeholders, which include:
 ❗ Unknown sources of credit memo. 
 ❗ System-created Auto Debit mistakes although credit memo are cleared timely.
 ❗ Significant discrepancies in credit memo values.
 
hashtag#Methods- I improved the data model and reconfigured the event logs using the label-splitting method to enhance the fitness of the process model. These involved:
 ✨ Using knowledge graphs to identify the relationship and homogeneity of the subprocesses split by categorical data.
 ✨ Applying label splitting.

These methods were instrumental in developing insightful analyses. The attached pictures show the process models (picture 2) and potential root causes of the issues (picture 3) I identified.

hashtag#Achievements - Using process mining, we successfully achieved the following goals:
 🔅 Generated a process model to enhance transparency for effective communication and clarification of misinformation that existed before process mining
 🔅 Identified root causes (process issues, data issues, system issues)
 🔅 Generated a robust control method to create checkpoints for automatic monitoring.
 🔅 Identify rework and wastes in debit reversals and even circular credit memo creations/debit reversals.
 🔅 Expected value above $1 million AUD once solutions are fully developed.


 
The multitude of factors, including process, data, system configuration issues, compound the complexity of the credit memo process. Additionally, this process is intricately related to the complaints,customer rebates & order returns process.

Without process mining, it would be highly unlikely to comprehend the process and its issues in such a thorough and objective way.
 
hashtag#FutureWork: this has yet to be completed. 
🔅 This is a good case for object-centric process mining.
🔅 Given the manual root cause analysis I conducted, I'm keen to train Generative AI to observe how it identifies root causes.

Hope this is helpful if your organisation finds analysing the credit memo process challenging.
